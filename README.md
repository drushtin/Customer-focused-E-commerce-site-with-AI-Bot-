# Customer-focused-E-commerce-site-with-AI-Bot-

Implementation of an AI-driven virtual assistant within an e-commerce platform, designed to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction. The proposed e-commerce site integrates advanced AI technologies to offer personalized and efficient assistance to users throughout their shopping journey. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, the virtual assistant learns from customer interactions to provide relevant product recommendations, answer queries, and offer support tailored to individual preferences and needs. Key features of the AI-powered virtual assistant include proactive engagement, real-time assistance, and seamless integration with the e-commerce interface. By analysing user behaviour and purchase history, the system anticipates customer needs, streamlining the shopping process and fostering a more intuitive and enjoyable experience.

We have implemented an AI based price negotiating chat bot which is a web application based on Flask framework using Python programming language. The website-based chat bot that attempts to improve user interaction with the E-Commerce website and reduce the abandonment of cart. The chat bot has a stored set of responses, but also takes dynamic user input into account and thus tends to provide relevant responses and suggests appropriate prices for the product. Since the product database is independent of the stored responses, newer products under the respective category can be easily added and removed and requires no modification of the stored chat bot responses needed.
